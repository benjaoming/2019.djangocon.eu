    "title": "Feeding the Pony: Contributing back to Django & How to make that work for you.",
    "abstract": "Django looks like it's doing just fine: it's a popular framework in a popular\nlanguage. We have major releases every six months. We have Django Girls, a\nFoundation (and Fellows), super conferences in glamorous locations, and more.\n\nBut the code is old and there's only the smallest number of people that regularly contribute.\nWe need more. We need you! \n\nWhat's more, as good as we are elsewhere as a community, the group of contributors \nisn't as diverse as the community at large: there are clearly barriers to entry here. We're\ntrying to change that, and we want to invite you to come and join-in.\n\nContributing to open source is great fun, it's a great learning opportunity, and it can really help your career. \n\nI'm going to tell you how to get involved, and how to get support in that. \n\nImportantly I'm going to tell you how to avoid the pitfalls. \n\nYou are qualified to contribute. More than that, your contribution is the\nfuture of Django. Come code!",
