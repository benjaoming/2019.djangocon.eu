# Questions

During talks, a host will select questions from the internet crowd. You can tag your question
Twitter with `djangoconQA` or send a question on the Freenode channel `#djangocon`.

Questions asked are subject to our [Code of Conduct](/conduct/) and any
perceived violations will be filtered out.

## Asking good questions

If a speaker takes questions a their talk, we encourage you to come to the mic
placed in the room. We will also take questions from internet audiences if time
permits. Please ask questions that are constructive and supportive:

* **A good question**: Is one that seeks to explore the topic of the talk;
  is perceived valuable to others in the audience; clarifies something that you
  found hard to understand in the talk; breaks the silence of the crowd, asking
  a supportive question for the speaker; the self-less question that seeks to
  bind knowledge from other people in the crowd with the speaker's; the
  practical recommendation that doesn't demand to know why the speaker didn't
  mention a, b, c.

You can read more examples of good conference questions in this
[Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/nov/11/dont-be-a-conference-troll-a-guide-to-asking-good-questions).

* **A bad question**: Is something that seeks to emphasize your own knowledge;
  seeks details at a level that is irrelevant to most people; or tries to trick
  the speaker, make them look bad or point out errors.
