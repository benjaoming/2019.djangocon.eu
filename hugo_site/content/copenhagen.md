# Copenhagen City & Transport Guide

## København

Copenhagen is a fantastic and beautiful city. Its well-designed urban infrastructure and its [atractions](https://www.visitdenmark.com) fascinate [milions of tourists](https://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/analyse/fakta-og-tal-om-turismen-i-danmark) every year. Since you are going to be one of them this time, here we lay out some of the basic things you will need to get the most out of your stay in our city.

To move around the capital - a quite small one -, we highly recommend you to rent a [bike](https://2019.djangocon.eu/bikes/). It is the most efficient and enviroment-friendly way to get to know things around here. Should you decide to use the public transport, that is not a problem! Below we have compiled the most important things you need to know about the public transport infrastructure.

## Transportation

Denmark has a very functional and well-connected public transport. As many other cities in Europe, Copenhagen is divided into [zones](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/trafikinformation/trafikkort/zonekort/) and you pay as you move along these. Trains, buses and the metro all use the same ticket, so if you buy a ticket from Point A to Point B, you may mix differnt kinds of transportation veichles.

Taxis (aka Taxa) in Denmark are quite expensive. A trip from the Kastrup / Copenhagen Airport to the city center will likely cost you around 400 Danish crowns (~60 USD) for a 10 KM trip. More information can be found [here](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/transportation/taxis).

### Public Transport Tickets

To buy a ticket the city offers different options. You can buy it at train stations, the DOT App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.unwire.projects.dmm) / [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1415-mobilbilletter/id494862453?mt=8)) or with the bus driver (only cash). The DOT app is the most convenience, since you can register your credit card and simply show your ticket from your smartphone when asked. 

For more information on which types of ticket you can buy, [visit this page](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/service/for-tourists/).

### Planning the trips

To know which line you need to jump in, you can use either [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) or the Rejseplanen ([Web](https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp/index.html?language=en_EN) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.rejseplanen&hl=en) / [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rejseplanen/id317007942?mt=8)). The latter is quite efficient and will inform you how many zones, the lines you need to get and the total cost of your trip.

### Payments (DKK: The Danish Kroner)

As you might know, Denmark's official currency is the Danish crown (Danske Kroner, a.k.a `DKK`). Some shops might accept Euro in cash as payment, but this is not a rule. 

Most establishments in Denmark (hotels, bars, restaurants, shops) will accept payment with credit cards (VISA and MasterCard). It is possible to get around using only credit card. However, cash is also still convenient.

Another interesting thing about the currency in Denmark is how prices are displayed. As you walk around, you will notice prices written as: `53,-` this means 53 Danish crowns.

### The language

In Denmark, [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language) is spoken - a language similar to German, Swedish and Norwegian, but the great majority of danes also speak fluent English. Should you feel like twisting your tongue a bit, here are the most common danish phrases you can use during your stay in the city:

Jeg hedder ... | My name is ...
Hvordan går det? | How are you?
Jeg har det godt, tak. | I am fine, thanks.
Tak | Thank you
Tusinde Tak | Thank you very much

And of course, you will need to know how to [pronounce](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=da&tl=en&text=God%20morgen.%0AGod%20aften.%0AGod%20eftermiddag.%0AJeg%20hedder%20Maria.%0AHvordan%20g%C3%A5r%20det%3F%0AJeg%20har%20det%20godt%2C%20tak.%0ATak.%0ATusinde%20Tak.%0AHej.%0AHej%20hej.) these words.
