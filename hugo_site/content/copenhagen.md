# Copenhagen City & Transport Guide

## København

Copenhagen is a fantastic and beautiful city. Its well-designed urban infrastructure and [attractions](https://www.visitdenmark.com) fascinate [millions of tourists](https://www.visitdenmark.dk/da/analyse/fakta-og-tal-om-turismen-i-danmark) every year. Since you are going to be one of them this time, here we lay out some of the basic things you will need to get the most out of your stay in our city.

To move around the capital - a quite small one - we highly recommend you to rent a [bike](https://2019.djangocon.eu/bikes/) with our partner. Since the whole city is pretty much covered with bicycle lanes, it will be a very efficient and enviroment-friendly way to get to know things around here. Should you decide to use the public transport, that is not a problem! Below we have compiled the most important things you need to know about the public transport infrastructure.

## Transportation

Denmark has a very functional and well-connected public transport. As many other cities in Europe, Copenhagen is divided into [zones](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/trafikinformation/trafikkort/zonekort/) and you pay as you move along these. Trains, buses and the metro all use the same ticket, so if you buy a ticket from Point A to Point B, you may mix differnt kinds of transportation veichles.

Taxis (aka Taxa) in Denmark are quite expensive. A trip from the Kastrup / Copenhagen Airport to the city center will likely cost you around 400 Danish crowns (~60 USD) for a 10 KM trip. More information can be found [here](https://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/transportation/taxis).

### Public Transport Tickets

To buy a ticket the city offers different options. You can purchase them at train stations, the DOT App ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.unwire.projects.dmm) / [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1415-mobilbilletter/id494862453?mt=8)) and from the bus driver (only cash). The DOT app is the most convenient, since you can register your credit card and simply show your ticket from your smartphone when asked. 

For more information on which types of ticket you can buy (weekly tickets, etc), [visit this page](https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/service/for-tourists/).

### Planning the trips

To know which connections connect to and from the conference [Venues](/venue/), you can use either [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com) or the Rejseplanen ([Web](https://www.rejseplanen.dk/webapp/index.html?language=en_EN) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.hafas.android.rejseplanen&hl=en) / [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rejseplanen/id317007942?mt=8)). The latter is more detailed and will inform you of travel fares, routes and total cost of your trip.

### Payments (DKK: The Danish Kroner)

As you might know, Denmark's official currency is the Danish crown (Danske Kroner, a.k.a `DKK`). Some shops might accept Euro in cash as payment, but this is not a rule. 

It is possible to get around Denmark using only credit cards (VISA and MasterCard). The great majority of the establishments (hotels, bars, restaurants, shops) will accept them. However, cash is also still convenient.

Another interesting thing about the currency in Denmark is how prices are displayed. As you walk around, you will notice prices written as: `53,-` this means 53 Danish crowns.

### The language

In Denmark, [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language) is spoken - a language similar to German, Swedish and Norwegian, but the great majority of danes speak fluent English, so there is no need to worry about communication with locals. Should you feel like twisting your tongue a bit, here are the most common danish phrases you can use during your stay in the city:

Expression | Translation
---------- | -----------
Godmorgen  | Good morning
Godaften | Good evening
God eftermiddag | Good afternoon
Jeg hedder ... | My name is ...
Hvordan går det? | How are you?
Jeg har det godt, tak. | I am fine, thanks.
Tak | Thank you
Tusinde Tak | Thank you very much
Hej | Hi
Hej hej | Bye

And of course, you will need to know how to [pronounce](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=da&tl=en&text=Godmorgen.%0AGodaften.%0AGod%20eftermiddag.%0AJeg%20hedder%20Maria.%0AHvordan%20g%C3%A5r%20det%3F%0AJeg%20har%20det%20godt%2C%20tak.%0ATak.%0ATusinde%20Tak.%0AHej.%0AHej%20hej.) these words.
