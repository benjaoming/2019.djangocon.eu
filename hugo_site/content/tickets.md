# Ticketing

The Pioneer tickets (early bird) are available <u>until January 31 23:59 UTC+1</u>. By buying tickets early, you'll get <strong>a reduced price</strong> because you're <strong>a pioneer</strong> and therefore:

* Helping us tremendously in our planning
* Giving us more time to handle any special requirements or inputs you may have
* Secured a ticket since the venue sold out the previous years (venue has less than 400 seats)
* Able to plan your trip earlier and perhaps share a ride or an apartment with another participant...

These are the ticket types that are on sale:

* <strong>Student/Concession Ticket (DKK 1500 / ~€201)</strong>
If you are currently enrolled as a full-time student or if you are currently without regular income. This ticket does not cover our costs for the conference, but we'll be able to provide it to you thanks to other people paying more for their ticket than the minimal price.
* <strong>Individual Ticket (DKK 2250 / ~€302)</strong>
If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
* <strong>Individual Supporter Ticket (DKK 3000 / ~€402)</strong>
If you are paying your ticket from your personal money and are not being reimbursed by your employer.
The additional money from this ticket type ensure we can afford offering cheaper tickets to students and other people who could not afford to join otherwise. Thank you for doing so!
* <strong>Business Ticket (DKK 3200 / ~€429)</strong>
If your employer is paying for the ticket or reimbursing you for your conference expenses.
* <strong>Business Supporter Ticket (DKK 4000 / ~€536)</strong>
Choose this ticket type if you or your employer want to especially support us doing this conference. It gives you everything the other tickets do as well, and it includes one post on our conference job board for your company.
