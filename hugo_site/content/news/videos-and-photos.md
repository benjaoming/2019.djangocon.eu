Thanks for a great conference - It's been about a month since DjangoCon 2019
ended, and memories are there to relive.

Firstly, with thanks to our official photographer
[Bartosz Pawlik (Bartek)](https://bartpawlik.format.com/), we have over 900
photos to share from the event.

conveniently viewed in chronological order on
