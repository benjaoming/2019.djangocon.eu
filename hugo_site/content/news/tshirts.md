We would like to share a little bit about the ~120 custom prints that were done during DjangoCon Europe 2019. Unfortunately this was far from enough for everyone, but maybe you can continue with the stencils below?

## Print on-demand

DjangoCon 2019 had print-on-demand merchandise, including bring-your-own-garment. The prints here handmade quality, the workshop recruited only students, and the fabrics could be both new and used.

There were some risks involved in this. The "on-demand" still means that we have to return unused t-shirts and garment coloring. Human resources were also sparse and in the end set the bar. To have a nice selection between colors, sizes and fits, it means that the outlet has to stock at least 4 times what it expects to sell, so you need a good relationship with your t-shirt supplier to be able to return all those unsold t-shirts.

Bring-your-own garment meant that for instance tote bags could be filled on the blank side:

## Constructive criticism

We would very much like that everyone at DjangoCons are offered an opportunity for a wearable memory of the event. We can recommend exploring similar ideas about on-demand printing. For the sake of consuming less textile resources and to help keep tickets affordable.

Many people have actually reached out and said that they were glad not to get a t-shirt that they wouldn't use anyways!

Granted, as many have objected, we did hand out a tote bag. This is largely due to the traditional sponsorship format: Handing out sponsor materials. But surely, future organizers can also think of new creative ways to address this.

There are other machine-driven print methods available which can produce much more reliable, faster and standardized prints than the screen printing method we applied at AFUK. Especially, we are sorry to see that technical mistakes have made some prints wear off at the first laundry.
