We are sold out and making final arrangements now. We (the volunteers organising this conference)
have lots and lots of things to do, and in case you find our news flow to be slow, please rest assure that
we are busy behind the scenes making this the best possible conference for each and everyone ðŸ’š

All [talks and workshops](/talks/) are now published as well as a [schedule](/schedule/).

## Don't have a ticket?

* You can still be part of the conference: All talks are streamed live.
* Asking questions will also be possible.

Information about streaming and asking questions will be published within the next days. Workshops are not streamed.

## Have a ticket?

We would like to hype a few things that we'll be announcing options for:

* Ordering a t-shirt at a low price with on-location printing
* Bring your own t-shirt and hand it in for screen-printing
* Signing up for workshops online
* Bring your own bottle and/or hot liquid container for zero-waste



*The organising team*
