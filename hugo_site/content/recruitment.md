# Recruitment
Standing out for recruitment at the event is not hard with help from a few tools we're providing both online and physically.

The recruitment exposure can be broken down to multiple elements, let's go through them.

**Sponsor packages** The basics is to attend the conference, however, to stand out the Bronze - Diamond sponsor levels allow for your brand to be seen online on the website as well as on printed material and on banners dependent on the level. 

**Job board** We have made a dedicated section on the conference website with job ads and in addition this year a physical board where attendees can see a printed version.

**Booth** If you are able to attend the conference and really want to stand out for your candidates getting a booth is the most effective tool. The booths are situated in a location all attendees visit multiple times a day.

**Slack** During the conference there is a virtual workspace for all attendees where news, announcements and communication take place. Here we have a dedicated channel for jobs which you can get access to post in.

**Networking** Concluding every conference day there is a networking session, which allow you to mingle and meet the prospective candidates.

The above is a non exhaustive list where you may have other creative wishes or ideas. Please contact [sponsors@djangocon.eu](mailto:sponsors@djangocon.eu) with questions and comments and we'll get back to you within 24 hours!
