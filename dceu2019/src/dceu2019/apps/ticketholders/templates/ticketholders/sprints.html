<h1>Sprints attendance</h1>

<p>To make it easy for us to know if you're going to the
<a href="https://2019.djangocon.eu/sprints/">Sprints</a>, please let us know in advance.</p>

<p>All ticket holders are welcome at the Sprints. Saying No or Maybe is not
something that will deny you access to the event at all, and maybe just going
one day will make you want to say Maybe (but say Yes!). But please try to keep
us updated for as long as this form is open, as it affects our planning for
food, drinks, electrical outlets etc.</p>

<form method="POST" style="width: 100%">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <p><button type="submit">Save changes</button></p>
</form>
