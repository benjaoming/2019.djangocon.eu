{% blocktrans %}Dear DjangoCon Europe 2019 attendee!

We have a special site for you! And its a Django project!

The site is intended as a space for a couple of things to happen before the
conference:

 * Joining the attendee Slack/IRC channel
 * Getting bikes in Copenhagen
 * Setting your personal preferences: Like Sprints attendance and meals
 * Fetching invoices for ticket purchases
 * Organizing accommodation and ride sharing
 * Maybe more?{% endblocktrans %}

Some things are still not done, but we are working on them.
